# runinlyon

The objective of this project is to help organisers of running events to decide either or not they can maintain and how they can adapt their events, according to COVID 19 constraints

To do so, the runinlyon package:

1) collects data from web sites (web scraping with Selenium)
2) trains a ML model that predicts the number of people per surface area

Futher development need to be implemented to allow the package to propose alternate course in case the number of people per surface area exceeds a given threshold.
